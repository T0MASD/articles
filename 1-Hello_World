Idea for this came some time in 2004. It was summer, tube in London was on strike and I was sitting on a bus. I'd rarely take a bus because of the trafic, on the flip side one gets to see the city. As I was enjoying the views, I was thinking about ways I could take and upload pictures and the stories from my phone to the web. That was the end of that. Fast forward 10 years and I'm planning to give it a go again. I have subscribed to [adventures in writing] course on stanford online. I hope this will help me communicate with my audience better. So please sit back, relax and enjoy the show where I'll be writing about things I do in my personal and professional lifes. profesional
